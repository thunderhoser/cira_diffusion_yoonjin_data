""" 

This is a script to train a score-based diffusion model based on Karras et al. (2022) 'EDM'.

This code is written in pytorch and is a smattering of functions from different places... so please don't hate me. 

WARNING: CURRENTLY THE CODE IS HARD CODED TO DO 1 CONDITIONAL IMAGE PREDICTION. 

You will need: 
1) Pytorch (this is the main lift here, duh)
2) Diffusers (this helps with model building... and eventually a pipeline)
3) Accelerate (this will help across GPUs if you have more than one)

Author: Randy Chase 
Date: May 2024 
Email: randy 'dot' chase 'at' colostate.edu 

Example call: 

$ accelerate launch train_diffusion_model_EDM_clean.py 

TODO:: 
1) Find the right pipeline in diffusers that is the same as the EDM sampler below. 
2) Generalize classes to do more than one image prediction.
